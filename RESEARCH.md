## APIs for audio / video capture

- Tokbox \
  Looks pretty promising, has an archiving API \

- Howler.js \
  Only does audio playback, but still may be of interest later \
  https://howlerjs.com/

- MediaRecorder API \
  Can record locally then process, so no issue with latency \
  Not available for Safari iOS or MSIE? \

- RecordRTC.js \
  Looks like just what we want. Has live demo that records to save to file or
  upload to YoutTube \
